The following is an excerpt from the Spectracom 9188 time server manual.
It describes the protocol emulated in detail.  It's included for reference.

This script is believed to fully support this protocol as documented, however
it has only been tested with one Spectracom device.  The very end of this
specitication notes a possible variation of the protocol.  This script uses
the more common space version of the protocol, not the leading zero version.
The script can be easily modified to include leading zeroes by removing the
regular expression that removes it in the formatTime() function.

6.2    Format 1:

This format provides the fully decoded time data stream. Format 1 converts
the received day of year data (001-366) to a date consisting of day of week,
month, and day of the month. Format 1 also  contains  a  time  sync  status
character, year, and time reflecting time zone offset and DST correction when
enabled. 

Format 1 data structure is shown below: 

CR LF I ^ WWW ^ DDMMMYY ^ HH:MM:SS CR LF 

where: 

CR  =   Carriage Return  
LF  =   Line Feed
I   =   Time Sync Status (space, ?, *)    
^   =   space separator
WWW =   Day of Week (SUN, MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT) 
DD  =   Numerical Day of Month (^1-31)
MMM =   Month (JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, DEC) 
YY  =   Year without century (99, 00, 01 etc.) 
HH  =   Hours (00-23)     
:   =   Colon separator 
MM  =   Minutes (00-59)  
SS  =   Seconds (00 - 60) 

The leading edge of the first character (CR) marks the on-time point of the
data stream. The time sync status character I is defined as described below: 

(Space) =  Whenever the front panel Time Sync lamp is green. 
?       =  When the receiver is unable to track any satellites
           and the Time Sync lamp is red.
*       =  When the receiver time is derived from the battery backed clock or
           set manually through the Setup Port Interface. 

Example: * FRI 20APR01 12:45:36 

The example data stream provides the following information: 

Sync Status: The clock is not time synchronized to GPS. Time is derived from 
             the battery backed clock or set manually 
Date:        Friday, April 20, 2001 
Time:        12:45:36 

Note:  Data Format 1 has a possible modification that may be made to the data
stream structure.  Most external systems utilizing Data Format 1 will look for
a single digit day of the month for day 1 through day 9, with a space in front
of each digit ( ^1, ^2, ^3 ... 10,11... ) whereas other systems need to see a
two digit day of the month for all days 1 through 9 with a leading 0 instead
of a space (01, 02, 03... 10,11...)

If your device requires the two digit day of the month for days 1 through 9,
the following procedure will change the Data Format 1 structure to provide this.
